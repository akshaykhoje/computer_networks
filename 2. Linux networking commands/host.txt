On Unix-like operating systems, the host command is a DNS lookup utility, finding the IP address of a domain name. It also performs reverse lookups, finding the domain name associated with an IP address.

host performs DNS lookups, converting domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given, host prints a summary of its command line arguments and options.
