On Linux operating systems, the arp command manipulates or displays the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache. It can add entries to the table, delete one, or display the current content.

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the address of a network neighbor for a given IPv4 address.

arp with no mode specifier prints the current content of the table. It is possible to limit the number of entries printed, by specifying a hardware address type, interface name or host address.

arp -d address deletes an ARP table entry. Root privilege is required to do this. The entry is found by IP address. If a hostname is given, it will be resolved before looking up the entry in the ARP table.
