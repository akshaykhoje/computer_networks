The ip command in linux is useful for sytem administrators and is a powerful tool for configuring network interfaces that any linux administrator should know. 
It is used to bring interfaces up or down, assign and remove addresses and routes, manage ARP cache, and much more.

ip command is seen replacing the ifconfig command and comes pre-installed in modern Linux distros.

Syntax : 
ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

COMMANDS:

1) Display information about all IP addresses :
ip addr show 
ip address
ip addr

2) Assign IP address to an interface :
ip addr add ADDRESS dev IFNAME
e.g.
sudo ip address add 192.168.121.45/24 dev enp2s0 

3) Assign multiple IP addresses to the same interface :
sudo ip address add 192.168.121.241/24 dev eth0
sudo ip address add 192.168.121.45/24 dev eth0

4) Display information about network interfaces :
ip link show 
# Unlike 'ip addr show', 'ip link show' this will not print info about the IP addresses associated with the device.

5) Alter the status of the interface UP/DOWN:
ip link set dev {DEVICE} {up|down}

6) Displaying and altering the routing table 
''' 
All network devices, whether they are hosts, routers, or other types of network nodes such as network attached printers, need to make decisions about where to route TCP/IP data packets. The routing table provides the configuration information required to make those decisions.
'''
ip route
ip route list
ip route list SELECTOR

7) Add a new route:
ip route add 192.168.121.0/24 via 192.168.121.1
ip route add 192.168.121.0/24 dev <IFNAME>
ip route add default via 192.168.121.1 dev eth0  // adds the default route

8) Delete a route:
'''
To delete an entry from the routing table, use the route add command. The syntax for deleting a route is the same as when adding.
'''
ip route del <route>
