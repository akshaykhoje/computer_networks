curl is a command-line utility for transferring data from or to a server designed to work without user interaction. With curl, you can download or upload data using one of the supported protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, IMAP, POP3 and FTP . curl provides a number of options allowing you to resume transfers, limit the bandwidth, proxy support, user authentication, and much more.

If no protocol is specified, curl tries to guess the protocol you want to use, and it will default to HTTP.
